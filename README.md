This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Haskell's `sort` function. The `sort` function, part of the `Data.List` module, requires that the list elements implement the `Ord` typeclass, which defines an ordering relation.  Attempting to sort a list containing elements that cannot be compared using the same ordering (e.g., a mix of Ints and Chars) will result in a compile-time type error. The solution showcases how to properly handle heterogeneous lists or ensure type consistency for sorting.
